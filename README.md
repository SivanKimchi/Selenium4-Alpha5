# Selenium4-Alpha5

* My private web automation project for practicing <b>Selenium <i> 4</i>- with Java</b>. <br/><br/>
* Selenium version is 4 + <b>Alpha 5</b> for RelativeLocators. This does not work on newer Alpha 6 (currently there is a bug)
* Project is built on <b>Maven</b>, using <b>JUnit</b> testing framework and <b>Page Object Model</b>. Page <b>Factory</b> does not work in this version (as far as I know). <br/>
* Passwords, users, paths, etc., are stored on _gitignore_ file (JsonValues.json), but template is available in JsonValues.json.template <br/>
